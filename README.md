## Passenger Counter App

### [Live Site](https://passenger-counter-2.netlify.app/)

This App counts people who enter a train station.

In this app I utilize the DOM element extensively.

To increment by one:

```
let countEl = document.getElementById("count-el") // pass in argument

let count = 0

function increment() {
    count += 1
    countEl.textContent = count
 }

```
